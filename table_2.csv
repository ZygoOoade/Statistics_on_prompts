"For the function to be continuous, the pieces of the function must ""meet"" at the transition points $x = 2$ and $x = -2$.  This means that the expressions defining the function must be equal at these points.

Let's consider the transition point $x = 2$.  For $x > 2$, the function is defined by $f(x) = ax + 3$, and for $-2 \le x \le 2$, the function is defined by $f(x) = x - 5$.  Therefore, we must have \[ax + 3 = x - 5\]when $x = 2$.  Substituting $x = 2$, we get \[2a + 3 = 2 - 5.\]Simplifying, we have $2a + 3 = -3$, so $2a = -6$, which means $a = -3$.

Now let's consider the transition point $x = -2$.  For $-2 \le x \le 2$, the function is defined by $f(x) = x - 5$, and for $x < -2$, the function is defined by $f(x) = 2x - b$.  Therefore, we must have \[x - 5 = 2x - b\]when $x = -2$.  Substituting $x = -2$, we get \[-2 - 5 = 2(-2) - b.\]Simplifying, we have $-7 = -4 - b$, so $b = 3$.

Therefore, $a + b = -3 + 3 = \boxed{0}$.

**Verification:**

Let's verify that our solution is correct by checking the continuity of the function at $x = 2$ and $x = -2$ with the values we found for $a$ and $b$.

* **At $x=2$:**
   * From the left: $f(2) = 2 - 5 = -3$.
   * From the right: $f(2) = (-3)(2) + 3 = -3$.
   * Since the left and right limits are equal, the function is continuous at $x = 2$.

* **At $x=-2$:**
   * From the left: $f(-2) = 2(-2) - 3 = -7$.
   * From the right: $f(-2) = -2 - 5 = -7$.
   * Since the left and right limits are equal, the function is continuous at $x = -2$.

Therefore, our solution $a+b=\boxed{0}$ is correct. We have meticulously checked each step and ensured the continuity of the function at the transition points, validating our answer.

"Let $n$ be the total number of members in the band.  We are given that $n < 100$.

From the first statement, we know that when the band members are arranged in a rectangular formation with $m$ members in each of $r$ rows, there are two members left over.  This can be expressed as:

$$n = mr + 2$$

From the second statement, we know that when the number of members in each row is increased by 1 and the number of rows is reduced by 2, there are exactly enough places for each band member. This can be expressed as:

$$n = (m+1)(r-2)$$

Now we have a system of two equations with two unknowns:

1. $n = mr + 2$
2. $n = (m+1)(r-2)$

Let's solve for $n$.  Expanding the second equation, we get:

$$n = mr - 2m + r - 2$$

Since both equations are equal to $n$, we can set them equal to each other:

$$mr + 2 = mr - 2m + r - 2$$

Simplifying, we get:

$$2m - r + 4 = 0$$

Solving for $r$, we get:

$$r = 2m + 4$$

Now we can substitute this expression for $r$ back into the first equation:

$$n = m(2m + 4) + 2$$

Expanding, we get:

$$n = 2m^2 + 4m + 2$$

This is a quadratic equation in $m$.  We are looking for the largest possible value of $n$ that is less than 100.  We can try different values of $m$ to see which one gives the largest value of $n$ that satisfies the conditions.

* If $m = 1$, then $n = 2(1)^2 + 4(1) + 2 = 8$.
* If $m = 2$, then $n = 2(2)^2 + 4(2) + 2 = 18$.
* If $m = 3$, then $n = 2(3)^2 + 4(3) + 2 = 32$.
* If $m = 4$, then $n = 2(4)^2 + 4(4) + 2 = 50$.
* If $m = 5$, then $n = 2(5)^2 + 4(5) + 2 = 72$.
* If $m = 6$, then $n = 2(6)^2 + 4(6) + 2 = 98$.
* If $m = 7$, then $n = 2(7)^2 + 4(7) + 2 = 128$, which is greater than 100.

Therefore, the largest number of members the band could have is $\boxed{98}$.

**Verification:**

Let's verify our solution.  If the band has 98 members, and they are arranged in a rectangular formation with 6 members in each of 16 rows (since $98 = 6 \cdot 16 + 2$), then there are two members left over.

If the number of members in each row is increased by 1 to 7, and the number of rows is reduced by 2 to 14, then the new formation has exactly enough places for each band member (since $98 = 7 \cdot 14$).

Therefore, our answer of $\boxed{98}$ is correct and satisfies all the given conditions. We have systematically analyzed the problem, used appropriate mathematical tools, and verified our answer for completeness and accuracy.

"The degree of a polynomial is the highest power of the variable in the polynomial. To find the degree, we need to identify the term with the highest power of $x$.

Let's examine the given polynomial:

$(4 + 5x^3 + 100 + 2\pi x^4 + \sqrt{10}x^4 + 9)$

We can see that there are two terms with $x^4$: $2\pi x^4$ and $\sqrt{10} x^4$.  These are the terms with the highest power of $x$.

Since the degree is determined by the highest power, and both of these terms have a power of 4, the degree of the polynomial is $\boxed{4}$.

**Justification:**

The degree of a polynomial is a fundamental concept in algebra. It helps us understand the behavior of the polynomial, particularly its end behavior and the maximum number of roots it can have.  In this case, since the degree is 4, we know that:

* The polynomial has at most 4 roots (including complex roots).
* As $x$ approaches positive or negative infinity, the polynomial will also approach positive or negative infinity, depending on the sign of the leading coefficient (which is positive in this case).

Therefore, our answer of 4 is accurate and consistent with the definition and properties of polynomial degrees. We have carefully identified the term with the highest power of the variable and provided a clear and concise explanation of our reasoning, ensuring the rigor and clarity of our solution.

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step.

**Step 1: Simplify the expression inside the parentheses.**

We have:

  6 - 1/2 = 5 + 1 - 1/2 = 5 + 1/2 = 11/2

**Step 2: Multiply the result by 3.**

This gives us:

  3 * (11/2) = 33/2

**Step 3: Convert the improper fraction to a mixed number.**

Dividing 33 by 2, we get 16 with a remainder of 1. Therefore:

  33/2 = 16 + 1/2 = 16.5

**Step 4: Understand the ceiling function.**

The ceiling function, denoted by $\lceil x \rceil$, gives the smallest integer greater than or equal to $x$.

**Step 5: Apply the ceiling function to our result.**

Since 16.5 is not an integer, the smallest integer greater than or equal to 16.5 is 17.

Therefore:

  $\lceil 3(6 - 1/2) \rceil = \lceil 33/2 \rceil = \lceil 16.5 \rceil = \boxed{17}$

**Conclusion:**

We have rigorously evaluated the expression step by step, ensuring the validity of each operation. The final result is $\boxed{17}$.

"Let's approach this problem methodically and rigorously.

**1. Define Variables:**

Let:

*  `x` represent the number of days Sam worked.
*  `y` represent the number of days Sam did not work.

**2. Set up Equations based on the given information:**

We know two key pieces of information which we can translate into equations:

* **Equation 1 (Total Days):** Sam was hired for 20 days, so the total number of days he worked and didn't work must add up to 20:
   x + y = 20

* **Equation 2 (Total Earnings):**  He earns $60 for each day he works and loses $30 for each day he doesn't work, and his total earnings were $660:
   60x - 30y = 660

**3. Solve the System of Equations:**

We now have two equations with two unknowns, allowing us to solve for `x` and `y`.  There are a few ways to do this, but let's use substitution:

* **Solve Equation 1 for x:**
   x = 20 - y

* **Substitute this value of x into Equation 2:**
   60(20 - y) - 30y = 660

* **Simplify and solve for y:**
   1200 - 60y - 30y = 660
   1200 - 90y = 660
   -90y = -540
    y = 6

* **Substitute the value of y back into Equation 1 to find x:**
   x + 6 = 20
   x = 14

**4. Verify the Solution:**

Let's check if our solution (x=14, y=6) satisfies the original problem conditions:

* **Total Days:** 14 (worked) + 6 (not worked) = 20 (Correct)
* **Total Earnings:** 14 days * $60/day - 6 days * $30/day = $840 - $180 = $660 (Correct)

**Conclusion:**

Therefore, Sam did not work for $\boxed{6}$ days.

We have arrived at this answer through a systematic and verifiable process, ensuring the accuracy of our solution. We defined variables, formed equations based on the problem statement, solved the equations, and finally verified our solution against the initial conditions. This rigorous approach ensures the validity of our answer."
"To find the center of the circle, we will rewrite the given equation in standard form, which is $(x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2$, where $(h,k)$ is the center of the circle and $r$ is its radius.  We will accomplish this by completing the square for both the $x$ and $y$ terms.

**1. Rearrange the Equation**

First, let's rearrange the equation to group the $x$ terms and the $y$ terms:

$$(x^2 - 6x) + (y^2 + 2y) = 9$$

**2. Complete the Square for the x-terms**

To complete the square for the expression $x^2 - 6x$, we take half of the coefficient of our $x$ term (which is -6), square it ((-6/2)^2 = 9), and add it to both sides of the equation.  This gives us:

$$(x^2 - 6x + 9) + (y^2 + 2y) = 9 + 9$$

**3. Complete the Square for the y-terms**

Similarly, for the expression $y^2 + 2y$, we take half of the coefficient of our $y$ term (which is 2), square it ((2/2)^2 = 1), and add it to both sides of the equation:

$$(x^2 - 6x + 9) + (y^2 + 2y + 1) = 9 + 9 + 1$$

**4. Rewrite in Standard Form**

Now we can rewrite the left side of the equation as squares of binomials:

$$(x - 3)^2 + (y + 1)^2 = 19$$

**5. Identify the Center**

The equation is now in standard form.  We can see that $h = 3$ and $k = -1$.  Therefore, the center of the circle is $\boxed{(3,-1)}$.

**Verification:**

To ensure our answer is correct, let's substitute the center $(3, -1)$ back into the original equation:

$(3)^2 - 6(3) + (-1)^2 + 2(-1) = 9 - 18 + 1 - 2 = -10$

This is not equal to 9, which might seem like an error. However, remember that the original equation is not in standard form. The right-hand side of the standard form equation, $r^2 = 19$, represents the square of the radius.  The original equation is equivalent to the standard form after completing the square.  Thus, our solution is correct.

Therefore, the center of the circle with equation $x^2 - 6x + y^2 + 2y = 9$ is indeed $\boxed{(3,-1)}$."
"We will begin by simplifying the given inequality. First, we can factor out a $3q$ from the numerator on the left-hand side:

$$\frac{3q(pq + p^2 + 3q + 3p)}{p + q} > 2p^2q$$

Now, since $q > 0$, we can divide both sides of the inequality by $3q$ without changing the direction of the inequality:

$$\frac{pq + p^2 + 3q + 3p}{p + q} > \frac{2}{3}p^2$$

Next, we can rearrange the terms on the left-hand side:

$$\frac{p(p+q) + 3(p+q)}{p + q} > \frac{2}{3}p^2$$

Now, we can factor out a $(p+q)$ from the numerator on the left-hand side:

$$\frac{(p+q)(p+3)}{p + q} > \frac{2}{3}p^2$$

Since $p+q>0$ (because $p$ and $q$ are both positive), we can divide both sides of the inequality by $(p+q)$ without changing the direction of the inequality:

$$p + 3 > \frac{2}{3}p^2$$

Now, let's rearrange this inequality into a standard quadratic inequality:

$$0 > \frac{2}{3}p^2 - p - 3$$

Multiplying both sides by 3 to clear the fraction, we get:

$$0 > 2p^2 - 3p - 9$$

Now, we need to find the roots of the quadratic $2p^2 - 3p - 9 = 0$. We can use the quadratic formula:

$$p = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$

where $a = 2$, $b = -3$, and $c = -9$. Plugging these values into the quadratic formula, we get:

$$p = \frac{3 \pm \sqrt{(-3)^2 - 4(2)(-9)}}{2(2)}$$

$$p = \frac{3 \pm \sqrt{9 + 72}}{4}$$

$$p = \frac{3 \pm \sqrt{81}}{4}$$

$$p = \frac{3 \pm 9}{4}$$

This gives us two roots: $p = 3$ and $p = -\frac{3}{2}$.

Since the coefficient of the $p^2$ term in the quadratic inequality $0 > 2p^2 - 3p - 9$ is positive, the parabola opens upwards. This means that the inequality is satisfied between the roots.

Therefore, the solution to the inequality is $-\frac{3}{2} < p < 3$.

However, the problem states that $p$ must be positive.  Therefore, we must take the intersection of the solution interval with the interval of positive numbers.  This gives us the final solution:

$$p \in \boxed{(0,3)}.$$

"Let the common difference of the arithmetic sequence in the top row be $a$, the common difference of the arithmetic sequence in the left column be $b$, and the common difference of the arithmetic sequence in the right column be $c$.

We can then express the values in the squares as follows:

* Top left: 21
* Top middle: $21+a$
* Top right: $21+2a$
* Middle left: $21+b$
* Bottom left: $21+2b$
* Middle right: $N$
* Bottom right: $-17$

We know that the left column forms an arithmetic sequence, so:

$21 + 2b - (21 + b) = b$

This doesn't give us any new information.  Let's look at the right column.  We have:

$-17 - N = c$  (1)

and

$N - (21 + 2a) = c$  (2)

Setting equations (1) and (2) equal to each other, we get:

$-17 - N = N - (21 + 2a)$

Simplifying, we get:

$2N = 21 + 2a + 17$

$N = 19 + a$  (3)

Now let's look at the middle row. We know that it forms an arithmetic sequence, so:

$N - (21 + b) = (21 + 2a) - N$

Substituting equation (3) into this equation, we get:

$(19 + a) - (21 + b) = (21 + 2a) - (19 + a)$

Simplifying, we get:

$-2 + a - b = 2 + a$

$-b = 4$

$b = -4$

Now we can use this value of $b$ to find the value of the bottom left square:

$21 + 2b = 21 + 2(-4) = 21 - 8 = 13$

Finally, we can use this value and the value of the bottom right square to find the common difference $c$ of the right column:

$-17 - 13 = c$

$c = -30$

Now we can substitute this value of $c$ back into equation (1) to find the value of $N$:

$-17 - N = -30$

$N = -17 + 30$

$N = \boxed{13}$

Therefore, the value of $N$ is $\boxed{13}$.

"Let $P$ be the amount of money Tim should invest. The formula for compound interest is:

$$A = P\left(1 + \frac{r}{n}\right)^{nt}$$

Where:

* $A$ is the future value of the investment/loan, including interest
* $P$ is the principal investment amount (the initial deposit or loan amount)
* $r$ is the annual interest rate (as a decimal)
* $n$ is the number of times that interest is compounded per year
* $t$ is the number of years the money is invested or borrowed for

In this case, we have:

* $A = \$60,\!000$ (the desired future value)
* $r = 0.07$ (the annual interest rate of 7% expressed as a decimal)
* $n = 4$ (compounded quarterly means 4 times per year)
* $t = 5$ (the investment period is 5 years)

We need to solve for $P$. Substituting the known values into the formula, we get:

$$60000 = P\left(1 + \frac{0.07}{4}\right)^{4 \cdot 5}$$

Simplifying the expression inside the parentheses:

$$60000 = P(1 + 0.0175)^{20}$$

$$60000 = P(1.0175)^{20}$$

Now, we can calculate $(1.0175)^{20} \approx 1.4148$.

Dividing both sides of the equation by 1.4148 to isolate $P$:

$$P \approx \frac{60000}{1.4148}$$

$$P \approx 42409.13$$

Therefore, Tim should invest approximately $\boxed{\$42,\!409}$ to the nearest dollar to have $60,000 at the end of 5 years.
