"For the piecewise function to be continuous, the cases must ""meet"" at $2$ and $-2$. For example, $ax+3$ and $x-5$ must be equal when $x=2$. This implies $a(2)+3=2-5$, which we solve to get $2a=-6 \Rightarrow a=-3$. Similarly, $x-5$ and $2x-b$ must be equal when $x=-2$. Substituting, we get $-2-5=2(-2)-b$, which implies $b=3$. So $a+b=-3+3=\boxed{0}$."
"Let $x$ be the number of band members in each row for the original formation, when two are left over.  Then we can write two equations from the given information: $$rx+2=m$$ $$(r-2)(x+1)=m$$ Setting these equal, we find: $$rx+2=(r-2)(x+1)=rx-2x+r-2$$ $$2=-2x+r-2$$ $$4=r-2x$$ We know that the band has less than 100 members.  Based on the first equation, we must have $rx$ less than 98.  We can guess and check some values of $r$ and $x$ in the last equation.  If $r=18$, then $x=7$, and $rx=126$ which is too big.  If $r=16$, then $x=6$, and $rx=96$, which is less than 98.  Checking back in the second formation, we see that $(16-2)(6+1)=14\cdot 7=98$ as it should.  This is the best we can do, so the largest number of members the band could have is $\boxed{98}$."
"This polynomial is not written in standard form.  However, we don't need to write it in standard form, nor do we need to pay attention to the coefficients.  We just look for the exponents on $x$.  We have an $x^4$ term and no other term of higher degree, so $\boxed{4}$ is the degree of the polynomial."
"Firstly, $3\left(6-\frac12\right)=18-1-\frac12=17-\frac12$.  Because $0\le\frac12<1$, we have $\left\lceil17-\frac12\right\rceil=\boxed{17}$."
"Call $x$ the number of days Sam works and $y$ the number of days he does not. We can set up the following system of equations to represent the given information: \begin{align*}
x+y &= 20 \\
60x - 30y &= 660 \\
\end{align*} The first equation represents the total number of days Sam works, and the second equation represents his total profit. Solving for $x$ in the first equation yields $x = 20 - y$. Substituting into the second equation gives $60(20-y) - 30y = 660$. Canceling a factor of $10$ and multiplying out gives $120 - 6y - 3y = 66$. This simplifies to $-9y = -54$, or $y = 6$. Thus, Sam did not work for $\boxed{6}$ days."
"Completing the square, we get $(x - 3)^2 + (y + 1)^2 = 19$. Therefore, the center of the circle is $\boxed{(3, -1)}$."
"First we'll simplify that complicated expression. We attempt to factor the numerator of the left side: \begin{align*}
pq^2+p^2q+3q^2+3pq &= q(pq + p^2 + 3q + 3p) \\
&= q[ p(q+p) + 3(q+p) ] \\
&= q(p+3)(q+p).
\end{align*}Substituting this in for the numerator in our inequality gives $$\frac{3q(p+3)(p+q)}{p+q}>2p^2q.$$We note that left hand side has $p+q$ in both the numerator and denominator.  We can only cancel these terms if $p+q \neq 0.$  Since we're looking for values of $p$ such that the inequality is true for all $q > 0,$ we need $p \geq 0$ so that $p + q \neq 0.$

Also because this must be true for every $q>0$, we can cancel the $q$'s on both sides. This gives  \begin{align*}
3(p+3)&>2p^2\Rightarrow\\
3p+9&>2p^2 \Rightarrow\\
0&>2p^2-3p-9.
\end{align*}Now we must solve this quadratic inequality. We can factor the quadratic as $2p^2-3p-9=(2p+3)(p-3)$. The roots are $p=3$ and $p=-1.5$. Since a graph of this parabola would open upwards, we know that the value of $2p^2 - 3p - 9$ is negative between the roots, so the solution to our inequality is $-1.5<p<3.$  But we still need $0 \leq p,$ so in interval notation the answer is $\boxed{[0,3)}$."
We have  \[\frac{x^4 + 2y^2}{6} = \frac{2^4 + 2(5^2)}{6} = \frac{16+2(25)}{6} = \frac{16+50}{6} = \frac{66}{6} = \boxed{11}.\]
"Since $18 - 14 = 4$, the common difference in the first column of squares is 4, so the number above 14 is $14 - 4 = 10$, and the number above 10 is $10 - 4 = 6$.  This is also the fourth number in the row, so the common difference in the row is $(6 - 21)/3 = -5$.

Then the seventh (and last) number in the row is $21 - 5 \cdot 6 = -9$.  In the second column, the common difference is $[(-17) - (-9)]/4 = -2$, so $N = -9 - (-2) = \boxed{-7}$."
"Recall the formula $A=P\left(1+\frac{r}{n}\right)^{nt}$, where $A$ is the end balance, $P$ is the principal, $r$ is the interest rate, $t$ is the number of years, and $n$ is the number of times the interest is compounded in a year. This formula represents the idea that the interest is compounded every $1/n$ years with the rate of $r/n$.

Substituting the given information, we have \[60,\!000=P\left(1+\frac{0.07}{4}\right)^{4 \cdot 5}.\]Solving for $P$ gives  $P=42409.474...$, which rounded to the nearest dollar is $\boxed{\$42409}$."
"The center of the circle is located at the midpoint of any diameter. Thus, the center of the circle is $\left(\frac{9+(-3)}{2}, \frac{(-5)+(-1)}{2}\right) = (3, -3)$. The sum of the coordinates of the center of the circle is therefore $3 + (-3) = \boxed{0}$."
"We substitute $f(2) = 5(2)^2 - \frac{1}{2} + 3 = \frac{45}{2}$ and $g(2) = (2)^2 - k = 4 - k$. So $f(2) - g(2) = 2$ gives us $\frac{45}{2} - 4 + k=2$. Solving for $k$, we find $k = \frac{4}{2} - \frac{45}{2} + \frac{8}{2}$ so $\boxed{k = \frac{-33}{2}}$."
"The easiest way to solve this problem is to convert everything into euros. Emily's five-dollar bill is equivalent to $5\text{ USD} \times \frac{1\text{ euro}}{1.25\text{ USD}}=4\text{ euros}$. Since the girls need 6 euros between them, Berengere must contribute $6-4=\boxed{2 \text{ euros}}$."
"The first cube root becomes $\sqrt[3]{9}$. $\sqrt[3]{8}=2$, so the second cube root becomes $\sqrt[3]{3}$. Multiplying these gives $\sqrt[3]{27} = \boxed{3}$."
"We note that $f(-2)=(-2)^3+3=-5$, so $g(f(-2))=g(-5)=2\cdot(-5)^2+2\cdot(-5)+1=41.$ Therefore our answer is $\boxed{41}$."
"Evaluating each value, $f(1) = 3 \cdot 1 + 1 = 4$; $f(f(1)) = f(4) = 4/2 = 2$; $f(f(f(1))) = f(2) = 2/2 = 1$; and finally $f(f(f(f(1)))) = f(1) = \boxed{4}$."
"We will begin with the smallest possible positive values of $x$.  For positive values of $x$, when $0<x<1$, the right side of our equation is equal to $\frac{1}{0}$, which is undefined. When $1 \le x < 2$  , the right side of our equation is equal to $1$, but $x - \lfloor x \rfloor $ cannot equal $1$.

When $2 \le x<3$, the right side of our equation is equal to $\frac{1}{2}$, so we have $x - \lfloor x \rfloor = \frac{1}{2}$.  This occurs when $x = 2 \frac{1}{2}$.

When $3 \le x<4$, the right side of our equation is equal to $\frac{1}{3}$, so we have $x - \lfloor x \rfloor = \frac{1}{3}$.  This occurs when $x = 3 \frac{1}{3}$.

When $4 \le x<5$, the right side of our equation is equal to $\frac{1}{4}$, so we have $x - \lfloor x \rfloor = \frac{1}{4}$.  This occurs when $x = 4 \frac{1}{4}$.

Then the sum of the three smallest positive solutions to $x$ is $2 \frac{1}{2} +3 \frac{1}{3}+4 \frac{1}{4} = \boxed{10\frac{1}{12}}.$"
"If the graph of $f$ is continuous, then the graphs of the two cases must meet when $x=2,$ which (loosely speaking) is the dividing point between the two cases. Therefore, we must have $2\cdot 2^2 -3 = 2a + 4.$ Solving this equation gives $a = \boxed{\frac{1}{2}}.$"
"If the graph of $f$ is continuous, then the graphs of the two cases must meet when $x=3$, which (loosely speaking) is the dividing point between the two cases.  Therefore, we must have $3(3^2) + 2 = 3a - 1$.  Solving this equation gives $a = \boxed{10}$."
"Since three faucets can fill a 100-gallon tub in 6 minutes, six can do it twice as fast, i.e. 3 minutes.  Additionally, the tub is a quarter the size and thus it will be filled four times as fast which gives $3/4$ minutes or $\boxed{45}$ seconds."
"The $y$-axis is where the $x$-coordinate is $0$.  Using the given points, as the $x$-coordinate decreases by $2$, the $y$-coordinate decreases by $4$.  So as the $x$-coordinate decreases by $1$ from $1$ to $0$, the $y$-coordinate will decrease by $2$ from $7$ to $5$.  The point is $\boxed{(0,5)}$."
"We only need to worry about the terms that multiply to have a degree of $2$. This would be given by the product of the terms $3x^2$ and $-4$ as well as the product of the terms $-2x$ and $-7x$. Thus, $$(3x^2) \times (-4) + (-2x) \times (-7x) = -12x^2 + 14x^2 = 2x^2,$$and the coefficient is $\boxed{2}$."
"We are looking for some $x$ such that $f(x)=64$.  We notice that by doubling $x$ we can double $f(x)$ as well and also that $f(3)=1$.

Applying $f(2x)=2f(x)$ repeatedly, we have: \begin{align*}
f(3)&=1,\\
f(6)&=2,\\
f(12)&=4,\\
f(24)&=8,\\
f(48)&=16,\\
f(96)&=32,\\
f(192)&=64.
\end{align*}So $f^{-1}(64)=\boxed{192}$."
"By the quadratic formula, the roots of the equation are  \begin{align*}
\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}&=\frac{-k\pm\sqrt{k^2-4(5)(1)}}{2(1)}\\
&=\frac{-k\pm\sqrt{k^2-20}}{2}.
\end{align*} We want the difference of the roots, so we take the larger minus the smaller:  \begin{align*}
\left(\frac{-k+\sqrt{k^2-20}}{2}\right)-\left(\frac{-k-\sqrt{k^2-20}}{2}\right)&=\frac{2\sqrt{k^2-20}}{2}\\
&=\sqrt{k^2-20}.
\end{align*} We are given that this difference is equal to $\sqrt{61}$, so we have \begin{align*}
\sqrt{k^2-20}&=\sqrt{61}\quad\Rightarrow\\
k^2-20&=61\quad\Rightarrow\\
k^2&=81\quad\Rightarrow\\
k&=\pm 9.
\end{align*} Thus the greatest possible value of $k$ is $\boxed{9}$."
"We begin by cross multiplying and then squaring both sides \begin{align*}
\frac{\sqrt{3x+5}}{\sqrt{6x+5}}&=\frac{\sqrt{5}}{3}\\
3\sqrt{3x+5}&=\sqrt{5}\cdot\sqrt{6x+5}\\
\left(3\sqrt{3x+5}\right)^2&=\left(\sqrt{5}\cdot\sqrt{6x+5}\right)^2\\
9(3x+5) &=5(6x+5)\\
20 &= 3x\\
x&=\boxed{\frac{20}{3}}.\\
\end{align*}Checking, we see that this value of $x$ satisfies the original equation, so it is not an extraneous solution."
"The side length of the square is the distance between the given points, or $\sqrt{(-1 - 2)^2 + (4 - (-3))^2} = \sqrt{3^2 + 7^2} = \sqrt{58}$. The area of the square is the square of the side length, or $\boxed{58}$."
"We can factor $n^2-11n+24$ as $(n-3)(n-8)$. For this quantity to be less than or equal to 0, one of the factors must be less than or equal to 0 and the other factor must be greater than or equal to 0. Specifically, since $n-8<n-3$ for all $n$, we must have $$n-8 \le 0 \le n-3.$$ The first inequality, $n-8\le 0$, tells us that $n\le 8$. The second inequality, $0\le n-3$, tells us that $n\ge 3$. The solutions to the original inequality must satisfy both conditions, so they are given by $3\le n\le 8$. The largest integer in this interval is $n=\boxed{8}$."
"Let the two solutions to the equation be $x_1$ and $x_2,$ where $x_1>x_2. $ It follows that  \[x_1 - x_2 = (x_1+5)-(x_2+5) = 20 - (-20) = \boxed{40}.\]"
"Using the first two conditions, we have that $0 \# 11 = 11 \# 0 = 11.$

Using the third condition, with $r=0$ and $s=11$, we have that $1 \# 11 = (0 \# 11)+12=11+12.$

As we increase $r$ by $1$, we increase $r \# 11$ by $s+1=11+1=12$. Since we want to increase $r$ $5$ times to find $11 \#5 =5 \# 11$, we want to increase $0 \# 11$ by $12$ five times. Therefore, we have $11 \# 5 = 5 \# 11 = 11+ 5 \cdot 12 = 11+60= \boxed{71}.$

More generally,
\[a \# b = ab + a + b.\]"
"Expanding the left side of the given equation, we have $x^2-x-6=14 \Rightarrow x^2-x-20=0$. Since in a quadratic  with equation of the form $ax^2+bx+c=0$ the sum of the roots is $-b/a$, the sum of the roots of the given equation is $1/1=\boxed{1}$."
"To get the square root out of the denominator, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by $(\sqrt{2}+1)$ so that the $\sqrt{2}$ is squared and $\sqrt{2}$ and $-\sqrt{2}$ cancel each other out.  $$\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}-1}\cdot\frac{\sqrt{2}+1}{\sqrt{2}+1}=\frac{\sqrt{2}+1}{2-\sqrt{2}+\sqrt{2}-1}=\frac{\sqrt{2}+1}{1}=\boxed{\sqrt{2}+1}$$"
"Let $d$ be the common difference in this arithmetic sequence.  Then the $13^{\text{th}}$ term is $5 + 12d = 29$.  Solving for $d$, we find $d = 2$.  Then the $50^{\text{th}}$ term is $5 + 49 \cdot 2 = \boxed{103}$."
"We expand each product separately: \begin{align*}
(2x-5)(x+7) &= 2x(x) + 2x(7) -5(x) -5(7)\\
&=2x^2 +14x - 5x -35\\
&= 2x^2 +9x - 35

(x+5)(2x-1) &=x(2x) + x(-1) +5(2x) + 5(-1)\\
&=2x^2 -x + 10x -5\\
&=2x^2 +9x - 5.
\end{align*}So, we have  \begin{align*}&\ \ \ \ (2x-5)(x+7) - (x+5)(2x-1) \\&= 2x^2+9x -35 - (2x^2 +9x -5) = \boxed{-30}.\end{align*}"
"Rewrite $\frac{4}{20}$ as $\frac{1}{5}$ and multiply both sides by $5x$ to obtain $x^2=25$.  The solutions of this equation are $\pm\sqrt{25}=\pm5$, and their sum is $(-5)+5=\boxed{0}$."
"We start by completing the square: \begin{align*}
2x^2 -12x + 3 &= 2(x^2-6x) +3 \\
&= 2(x^2 -6x + (6/2)^2 - (6/2)^2) + 3\\
& = 2((x-3)^2 -3^2) + 3 \\
&= 2(x-3)^2 - 2\cdot 3^2 + 3\\
&= 2(x-3)^2 -15
.\end{align*} Since the square of a real number is at least 0, we have $(x-3)^2\ge 0$, where $(x-3)^2 =0$ only if $x=3$.   Therefore, $2(x-3)^2 - 15$ is minimized when $x=\boxed{3}.$"
"We know that $\lfloor x\rfloor \leq x < \lfloor x\rfloor + 1$. This implies that $\lfloor x\rfloor^2 \leq x\cdot\lfloor x\rfloor < \left(\lfloor x\rfloor + 1\right)^2$ for all values of $x$. In particular since $x\cdot\lfloor x\rfloor=70$ and $8^2<70<9^2$, we can conclude that $8<x<9\Longrightarrow\lfloor x\rfloor=8$. From there, all we have to do is divide to get that $x=\frac{70}{8}=\boxed{8.75}$."
"If the length is $l$ and the width is $w$, then the perimeter is $2l+2w$. We can set up the equations $2l+2w=60 \Rightarrow l+w=30$ and $l=2w$. Now we substitute $l$ in terms of $w$ into the first equation and get $l+w=2w+w=30$, so $w=10$ and $l=2(10)=20$. That means the area of the rectangular garden is $lw=20(10)=\boxed{200}$ square feet."
$f(4)=4^2-4=16-4=\boxed{12}$.
"For a triangle to exist, the sum of two sides of the triangle must be greater than the third. Therefore, we have three formulas: $x^2+7>10 \to x^2>3$, $x^2+10>7 \to x^2>-3$, and $7+10>x^2 \to x^2<17$. Thus, we have two quadratics, $x^2>3$ and $x^2<17$. Therefore, possible values for $x$ are $\boxed{2, 3, \text{ and } 4}$."
"Let our integer be $x$.  Then we have that $x^2 = 182 + x$, or $x^2 - x - 182 = 0$.  The sum of the roots of this equation is just $-(-1) = \boxed{1}$.  Note that we are given that one solution is an integer, and so the other one must be as well since they add to 1.

Note that we can factor $x^2 - x - 182 = 0$ as $(x - 14)(x + 13) = 0$.  So the integers that work are 14 and $-13$, and their sum is $14 + (-13) = 1,$ as expected."
"To find the maximum height of the ball is to maximize the expression $-16t^2+64t+31$. We will do this by completing the square. Factoring a $-16$ from the first two terms, we have  \[-16t^2+64t+31=-16(t^2-4t)+31.\]To complete the square, we add and subtract $(-4/2)^2=4$ inside the parenthesis to get \begin{align*}
-16(t^2-4t)+31&=-16(t^2-4t+4-4)+31\\
&=-16([t-2]^2-4)+31\\
&=-16(t-2)^2+95.
\end{align*}Since $-16(t-2)^2$ is always non-positive, the maximum value of the expression is achieved when $-16(t-2)^2=0$, so the maximum value is $0+95=\boxed{95}$ feet."
"Average speed is defined as distance traveled divided by time traveled. Karen drove 165 miles in $3\frac{40}{60}=3\frac{2}{3}=\frac{11}{3}$ hours, so her average speed was $\frac{165}{\frac{11}{3}}=3\cdot15=\boxed{45}$ miles per hour."
"In order for the expression to have a domain of all real numbers, the quadratic $x^2+bx+8 = 0$ must have no real roots.  The discriminant of this quadratic is $b^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 8 = b^2 - 32$.  The quadratic has no real roots if and only if the discriminant is negative, so $b^2 - 32 < 0$, or $b^2 < 32$.  The greatest integer $b$ that satisfies this inequality is $\boxed{5}$."
"We might recognize the top as $\frac{2}{3}$, and the bottom as $\frac{4}{3}$, thereby giving you a value of $\frac{1}{2}$.  If not, call the numerator $x$.  Multiplying by 10, and subtracting $x$, you get 9x = 6, and thus, $x = \frac{2}{3}$.  We then notice that the denominator is $1 + \frac{x}{2}$, thereby giving us a value of $\boxed{\frac{1}{2}}$ for the entire fraction."
"If the coordinates of the point halfway between the two points are $(x,y)$, then $x$ must be the average of the $x$-coordinates $3$ and $5$ and $y$ must be the average of the $y$-coordinates $7$ and $1$. The average of $3$ and $5$ is $\frac{3+5}{2}=4$ and the average of $7$ and $1$ is $\frac{7+1}{2}=4$, so the $(x,y) = \boxed{(4,4)}$."
"First, remember that the slope of a line in the form of $y=mx+b$ is equal to $m$.  So, the line must take the form $y=-7x+b$.  Next, substitute the point $(3,0)$ and solve for $b$: \begin{align*}
0&=-7(3)+b\\
\Rightarrow\qquad 0&=-21+b\\
\Rightarrow\qquad 21&=b
\end{align*} Therefore, the value of $m+b$ is $-7+21=\boxed{14}$."
"We can rewrite the equation $x^2-6y-3=-y^2-4x$ as $x^2+4x+y^2-6y=3$. Completing the square, we have $(x+2)^2-4+(y-3)^2-9=3$, or $(x+2)^2+(y-3)^2=16$. This is the equation of a circle of radius $r=4$ and with center $(a,b)=(-2,3)$. Therefore, $a+b+r=-2+3+4=\boxed{5}$."
"$2f(4)=g(4)$, so $2\left(16-8+m\right)=16-8+4m$. Expanding the left-hand side gives $16+2m=8+4m$, or $8=2m$ and $m=\boxed{4}$."
"If $x^2 + tx - 10= (x+a)(x+b)$, then \[x^2 + tx -10 = x^2 + ax +bx +ab = x^2 +(a+b)x + ab.\]Therefore, we must have $ab = -10$, and for any such $a$ and $b$, we have $t = a+b$.  Our possibilities are as follows: \[\begin{array}{ccc}a&b&a+b\\\hline
-1 & 10 & 9\\
-2 & 5 & 3\\
-5 & 2 & -3\\
-10 & 1 & -9
